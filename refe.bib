abstract="Di Pietro and Komargodski have recently demonstrated a four-dimensional counterpart of Cardy's formula, which gives the leading high-temperature ($\beta$ {\textrightarrow} 0) behavior of supersymmetric partition functions ZSUSY($\beta$). Focusing on superconformal theories, we elaborate on the subleading contributions to their formula when applied to free chiral and U(1) vector multiplets. In particular, we see that the high-temperature expansion of ln ZSUSY($\beta$) terminates at order $\beta$0. We also demonstrate how their formula must be modified when applied to SU(N ) toric quiver gauge theories in the planar (N {\textrightarrow} âˆž) limit. Our method for regularizing the one-loop determinants of chiral and vector multiplets helps to clarify the relation between the 4d                                                                                                                     N                      =                      1                                                        {\$}{\$} {\backslash}mathcal{\{}N{\}}=1 {\$}{\$}                 superconformal index and its corresponding supersymmetric partition function obtained by path-integration.",
