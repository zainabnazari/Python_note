The parameter given to the plt.margin function tells the size of margin between the extreme points (the left-most, right-most, lowest and highest points) and the border of the plot. The value is relative to the distance between opposite extreme points. That means: If our data starts at the x-position of 0 and ends at the x-position of 2.5, then margin parameter of 1 would lead to the plot starting at $x_{min}-margin_x*(x_{max}-x_{min}) = -2.5$ and ending at $x_{max}-margin_x*(x_{max}-x_{min}) = 5$. The same principle applies for the y-axis. The function can be called with one parameter that applies to both the x- and y-axis, or with two parameters that may differ for x- and y-axis.
